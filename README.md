## Insights

Social drinkers show the most absence from work on average of 8.25 hours. 

Employees who spend high on transport tend to be absent from work. 

Highest period of absence was been recorded during season of high rainfall – spring. 

Despite Monday being the first day of the week, it has been recorded to have the highest period of 
absence. 

With average service time of 13 years, employees show peak period of absence; 11.31. 

## Recommendations

Employees should be advised on the effects of alcoholic drinks and persuaded to eliminate it during 
weekdays. 

The company should find a way in subsidizing transport expense for employees who spend high on it. 

Regarding the top reasons given, interaction and handling of equipment onsite needs to be reviewed. 

Since natural causes like rainfall cannot be controlled, initiative like work-from-home should be 
introduced.
